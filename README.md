# Esther O'Keefe 

Hiya! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Esther. I'm a university dropout software and 
electronics engineer with a keen interest in 
strictly-regulated environments, be they constrained by 
performance, safety, finance, whatever. If it *needs* to work, 
I'm interested.

I've spent a bunch of time learning various programming languages,
many of which aren't "practical" but which give me a unique
perspective on programming itself. I like to think of programming
as a means of human communication, and write code to be *read*, not
just run. To that end, some of my favourite languages lately are 
Ada and Cobol.

That is me, as relates to code. Have a lovely day!
