# Esther O'Keefe 

Hiya! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Esther. I'm a uni dropout software person trying her darndest to
specialise in high-performance systems.

Lately I've been [streaming on Twitch](https://twitch.tv/esthermations)! I
really enjoy explaining what I'm working on, helping others learn to code and
just providing a relaxed environment.

I'm currently very unemployed. If think you I may be a useful junior to have 
around, my contact details and CV are available on my
[website](https://esther.okeefe.lgbt). Have a lovely day!
