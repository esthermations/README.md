# Esther O'Keefe 

Hiya! I'm Esther. I'm a university dropout programmer and engineer 
with a keen interest in strictly-regulated environments, be they 
constrained by performance, safety, finance, whatever. 
If it *needs* to work, I'm interested.

I've spent a bunch of time learning various programming languages,
many of which aren't "practical" but which give me a unique
perspective on programming itself. I'm a big fan of readability
and *obvious* code, so I'm a fan of languages like Ada and Cobol.

I also love human languages, and Portuguese is a special passion of
mine. É sempre bom conhecer novos amigos! Não hesites dizer oi. ☺️
