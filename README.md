# Esther O'Keefe 

Hiya! 👋 I'm Esther. I'm a uni dropout software engineer with a keen interest in
programming close to the metal, especially on systems which are performance- or
safety-critical. Whatever it is I'm working on, I like to dig one level deeper
to see what makes it all tick, paying close attention to how good design can
reduce human error.

I'm a language person too! I studied Japanese 🇯🇵 for three years at uni and
I've been learning Portuguese 🇵🇹 and Latin 🇻🇦 in my spare time for the last
year or so. I'd love to have an excuse to learn other languages, too! 😁

I'm currently very unemployed. If think I may be a useful junior to have around,
my contact details and CV are available on my
[website](https://esther.okeefe.lgbt). Have a lovely day!
