# Esther O'Keefe 

Hiya! üëã I'm Esther. I'm a university dropout software and 
electronics engineer with a keen interest in 
strictly-regulated environments, be they constrained by 
performance, safety, finance, whatever. If it *needs* to work, 
I'm interested.

I really like being close to the metal, so I love working in
languages like C, C++ and Ada. I've tried most of the new wave of
system programming languages and D is my favourite.

I've spent a bunch of time learning various programming languages,
many of which aren't "practical" but which give me a unique
perspective on programming itself. I'm a big fan of readability
and *obvious* code, so I'm a fan of languages like Ada and Cobol.

I also love human languages - Portuguese is a special passion of
mine. √â sempre bom conhecer novos amigos! N√£o hesites dizer oi. ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Erm, okay. That is me, as relates to code. Have a lovely day!
