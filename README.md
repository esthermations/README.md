# Esther O'Keefe 

Hiya! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Esther. I'm a university dropout software and 
electronics engineer with a keen interest in strictly-regulated 
environments, be they constrained by performance, safety, finance,
whatever. If it *needs* to work, I'm interested.

I've spent a bunch of time learning various programming languages,
many of which aren't "practical" but which give me a unique
perspective on programming itself. I like to think of programming
as a means of human communication, and write code to be *read*, not
just run. To that end, some of my favourite languages lately are 
Ada and Cobol. ðŸ˜‡

ðŸ§³ I'm currently looking for work! If you're interested, please send 
me an email to esthermations at gmail. Have a lovely day!
