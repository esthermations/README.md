# Esther O'Keefe 

Hiya! ğŸ‘‹ I'm Esther. I'm a uni dropout software engineer with a keen interest in
programming close to the metal, especially on systems which are performance- or
safety-critical. Whatever it is I'm working on, I like to dig one level deeper
to see what makes it all tick. 

I'm a language person and am really big on code as a means of human
communication. I studied Japanese ğŸ‡¯ğŸ‡µ at uni and I've been learning Portuguese
ğŸ‡µğŸ‡¹ and Latin ğŸ‡»ğŸ‡¦ in my spare time for the last year or so.

I'm currently looking for work! I'm an Australian ğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡º citizen located in
Hobart. If you're interested, my contact details and CV are available on my
[website](https://esther.okeefe.lgbt). Have a lovely day!
