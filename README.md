# Esther O'Keefe 

Hiya! 👋 I'm Esther. I'm a university dropout software and 
firmware engineer with a keen interest in programming close to the metal, 
especially on systems which are performance- or safety-critical. 
If it *needs* to work, and work fast enough, I'm interested.

Besides uni projects I've been plugging away at [cargame-ada](https://github.com/esthermations/cargame-ada),
a simple 3D game written in Ada. It's largely been a testbed for me to try 
different designs for game engines, and test their performance and how much 
I like their code legibility.

My favourite languages are Ada, C, and C++. In that order! 😁

🧳 I'm currently looking for work! If you're interested, my contact 
details and CV are available on my [website](https://esther.okeefe.lgbt). 
Have a lovely day!
