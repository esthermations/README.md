# Esther O'Keefe 

Hiya! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Esther. I'm a university dropout software and 
electronics engineer with a keen interest in 
strictly-regulated environments, be they constrained by 
performance, safety, finance, whatever. If it *needs* to work, 
I'm interested.

I've spent a bunch of time learning various programming languages,
many of which aren't "practical" but which give me a unique
perspective on programming itself. I'm a big fan of readability
and *obvious* code, so I'm a fan of languages like Ada and Cobol,
and am willing to get into arguments with functional programming
people about what is wrong with them. ðŸ˜‡

Erm, okay. That is me, as relates to code. Have a lovely day!
